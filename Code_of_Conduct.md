# Code of Conduct

## Introduction

We are committed to fostering a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors and participants in our community. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for behavior and provides guidelines for reporting unacceptable behavior.

## Our Pledge

We pledge to make participation in this community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Showing empathy towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior—or have any other concerns—please report it by contacting us at [your-email@example.com]. All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. We will maintain confidentiality regarding the reporter of any incident.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any participant will not be tolerated. Community leaders may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the community.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
